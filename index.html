      <img class="lake" src="raintree.jpg" alt="Picture of Me">

      <p class="bio">Hello and welcome. My name is Devin Robinson. I am currently a college sophomore student at Ozark Technical Community College in Springfield, Missouri. About 150 miles north of Springfield, Kansas City, Missouri is the place I was born and raised for 19 years of my life. Pursing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Scientist is my major along with pursing a minor in Cyber Sercurity. I plan to achieve both my major and my minor at the college of Missouri State University in Springfield, MIssouri. The classes I have taken have been mostly general eduaction college classes with a few computer classes. My future classes will be mostly computer related classes as I move foward into my degree. The highest level of math will be calculus 2, so I am looking foward to that. I am xpected to graduate in December of 2022 at Missuri State. I love the technology industry and something about computer and the internet just fascinates me deeply. Understanding and learning how the internet works and how technology works has been a dream of mine since I was a kid, wanting to know how videogames and websites function. I hope to continue to learn and grow as technology continues to change and improve.</p>
